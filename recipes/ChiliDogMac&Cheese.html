<h4>Chili Dog Mac & Cheese Result</h4>

<p>According to the person who originally made this recipe, this dish 
    didn't really blend the flavors well together. It could have been
    the lack of creamy sauce, or something else. The texture was definitely
    there, but there was definitely some gaps in the recipe.

<p>If you'd like something that feels and tastes like an American Goulash
    with hot dogs, then I would recommend this for your taste buds!
